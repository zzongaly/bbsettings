.SH DESCRIPTION
The compiler is an optimizing C/C++ compiler that accepts C++ as well as American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard C source code and produces target specific object code.  This compiler builds object code directly from your C++ program source.  There is no intermediate C version of the program.

The 
.B Optimizing C Compiler User's Guide
discusses the characteristics and limitations of this C/C++ compiler, as well as the languages, features and keywords supported.
.SH OPTIONS
The following options are accepted by this tool:
.SS Processor Options:
.SS
.TP
-v=0,1,2,3
Specify PRU version V0,V1,V2, or V3 When not specified by the user, the compiler defaults to 3
.SS Optimization Options:
.SS
.TP
-mf[=0-5]
Control speed vs. size trade-offs in optimization.  A value of 5 indicates fully optimizing for speed with a potentially large code size penalty, while a value of 0 indicates fully optimizing for size. Values between 0 and 5 indicate trade-offs between the two extremes. The argument to the option is optional, and if not specified it will default to: 4
.TP
-O[=off,0,1,2,3,4]
Set compiler optimization level.

Level 0 includes register optimizations.  Level 1 adds local optimizations. Level 2 further adds global optimizations. Level 3 further adds interprocedure optimizations. Level 4 adds whole program optimizations. Level 4 must be passed to the linker for the optimizations to take affect. The argument to the option is optional, and if not specified it will default to: 2
