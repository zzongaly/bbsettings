#BBB-PRU

This is an example program to figure out how to program the PRU units in the Beagle Bone Black.

## 3rd party tools that are needed.

The vendors/am335x_pru_package directory includes a driver and assembler that can be used to generate and load binaries to be ran on the PRUs. The vendors/install.sh script takes care of compiling and installing it.

The vendors/pru_2.0.0B2 directory should contain the C compiler for generating binaries to run in the PRU. However TI's licence prevents redistribution of it so you have to manually download it from [here](http://software-dl.ti.com/codegen/non-esd/downloads/beta.htm) and run the installer script. This will generate a pru_2.0.0B2 directory which you'll have to move into vendors/pru_2.0.0B2. vendors/install.sh copies some files from here to system-wide directories for convenience.

## Writing PRU assembly code.

Look at the app-assembler example.

## Writing PRU C code

Look at the app-c example.
